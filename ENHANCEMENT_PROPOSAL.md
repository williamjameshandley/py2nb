# py2nb Enhancement: Installation Blocks and Modern Notebook Support

## Summary

This enhancement adds support for installation blocks (`#!` syntax) and modern notebook metadata to py2nb, addressing needs identified during educational workshop development.

## New Features

### 1. Installation Block Syntax (`#!`)

Allows creation of dedicated installation cells for better dependency management:

```python
#| # Workshop Title
#| Introduction and overview

#! pip install numpy matplotlib
#! pip install scipy

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#| ## Advanced Section

#! pip install seaborn  # Install when needed

import seaborn as sns
```

**Benefits:**
- Modular dependency installation
- Better Google Colab compatibility
- Educational progression (install concepts when taught)

### 2. Enhanced Notebook Metadata

Adds proper kernelspec and language_info metadata for modern Jupyter compatibility:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "kernelspec": {
      "display_name": "Python 3",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "python3"
    },
    "language_info": {
      "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3},
      "file_extension": ".py",
      "mimetype": "text/x-python", 
      "name": "python",
      "nbconvert_exporter": "python",
      "pygments_lexer": "ipython3",
      "version": "3.8.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Notebook Validation

Built-in validation ensures generated notebooks work across all Jupyter environments:

- Proper execution_count handling
- Correct outputs array initialization  
- Metadata consistency checks
- JSON structure validation

### 4. Enhanced CLI Options

```bash
py2nb script.py                    # Basic conversion
py2nb script.py --no-validate      # Skip validation  
py2nb script.py --executed         # Guided executed version creation
```

## Backward Compatibility

All existing py2nb syntax remains unchanged:
- `#|` for markdown cells ✓
- `#-` for cell splits ✓
- Regular code handling ✓

Only addition is the new `#!` syntax.

## Use Cases

This enhancement was developed based on real workshop needs where:

1. **Dependencies needed modular installation** - not all at the start
2. **Generated notebooks failed validation** in some environments  
3. **Workshop flow required** install-when-needed patterns
4. **Educational value improved** with progressive dependency introduction

## Testing

The enhanced version includes:
- ✓ Example script demonstrating all features
- ✓ Validation of generated notebook structure
- ✓ Backward compatibility verification
- ✓ Modern nbformat compatibility
